Sakura Library
==============

[1] http://alma-intweb.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~sakura/


Overview
--------

Sakura is a high performance library for astronomical data analysis, developed by the ALMA Computing Team of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ).

ALMA - Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array - is the largest astronomical project in existence: a single telescope of revolutionary design, composed of 66 high precision antennas located on the Chajnantor plateau, 5000 meters altitude in northern Chile.

Sakura is optimized to use Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions.
SIMD instructions boost performances by leveraging data level parallelism features commonly available in modern CPUs.

For more information in Japanese, please refer to the official ALMA web page of NAOJ [1], and search for Sakura.

Installation
------------

Sakura is currently distributed in source form only.
You have to build Sakura from source to install the library.
Please refer to the Installation Procedure section below for details.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Sakura should work on any platform fulfilling the prerequisites listed in the Installation Procedure. 

Tested Platforms
----------------

Sakura has been successfully tested on the following platforms
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL5)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL6)
- Canonical Ubuntu 14.4
- Apple OS X 10.8
- Apple OS X 10.10
- Apple OS X 10.11

Installation Procedure
----------------------

Sakura installation procedure is broken into 5 steps:
1. Prerequisites
2. Downloading the source
3. Building
4. Testing
5. Final install

1. Prerequisites
--------------------------

1.1 Prerequisites common to Linux and Apple OS X Operating Systems
1.1.1 Prerequisites coming from dependencies of the build system on software tools
* cmake 2.8 or higher
* doxygen 1.8 or higher
* gtest 1.7 or higher

1.1.2 Prerequisites coming from dependencies of Sakura on third-party external libraries
Mandatory prerequisites:
* eigen 3.2 or higher
* fftw 3.3.2 or higher. If you build fftw from source, use the configure options "--enable-shared" to build libfftw as a shared library.
Optional prerequisites:
* lib4cxx. This library adds a logging feature to Sakura, allowing messages from Sakura to be logged at run-time. 

1.2 Linux specific Prerequisites
* C++ compiler with C++11 support (gcc/g++ 4.8 or higher or clang/clang++ 3.5 or higher). Note: default gcc/g++ on RHEL5 and some versions of RHEL6 is not compliant with this requirement, so you must install a compliant compiler to build Sakura on these operating systems.

1.3 Apple OS X specific Prerequisites
* xcode 5.1 or higher

2. Downloading the Source
-------------------------

Sakura library source code releases are distributed in gzip-compressed tarballs named libsakura-X.Y.Z.tar.gz.
Latest release can be downloaded from:

ftp://anonymous:ftp@alma-dl.mtk.nao.ac.jp/sakura/releases/latest_src

3. Building
-----------

3.1 Expand Sakura library tarball file:

[work]$ tar -xvzf libsakura-src-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

Above command creates a libsakura directory in your working directory. 

3.2 Setup a Google Test framework for Sakura

Sakura library uses Google Test framework (gtest) to run unit tests.

3.2.1 Expand a gtest bundle (e.g. gtest-1.7.0.zip) into the libsakura directory:

[work]$ unzip gtest-1.7.0.zip -d libsakura

3.2.2 Create in the libsakura directory a symbolic link named gtest, pointing to the expanded gtest bundle:  
   
[work]$ cd libsakura
[libsakura]$ ln -s gtest-1.7.0 gtest

3.3 Generate Sakura build system

In this step, you run cmake to generate Sakura build system.

You might typically have to customize the cmake command line to specify:
- where you want Sakura to be installed
- and where the fftw3 and Eigen libraries are installed in your system

In the simplest case where compliant versions of fftw3 and Eigen are automatically found by cmake, you simply have to run:

gcc:
[libsakura]$ cd build
[build]$ cmake ..

clang: (especially for Mac users)
[libsakura]$ cd build
[build]$ env CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..

A typical customized cmake command would look like:
[build]$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/sakura/installation_dir -D FFTW3_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/my_system/fftw3 -D EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/my_system/eigen ..
 
cmake options you may want to customize:
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
  Specifies the directory where to install Sakura. 
  Add to cmake command line e.g: -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/lib/sakura

FFTW3_ROOT_DIR
  Specifies the directory where the fftw library is installed on your system.
  Add to cmake command line e.g: -D FFTW3_ROOT_DIR=/opt/fftw/fftw-3.3.2

EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR
  Specifies the directory where the Eigen library is installed on your system.
  Add to cmake command line e.g: -D -D EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/eigen/eigen-3.2.0

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
  Specifies a build type. Allowed values:
  * Debug          Debug mode. Compiler flag is -g
  * Release        Release mode. Compiler flag is -O3 -DNDEBUG
  * RelWithDebInfo Debug+Release mode. Compiler flag is -g -O3 -DNDEBUG
  Add to cmake command line e.g: -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

SIMD_ARCH
  Specify an optimization option. Allowed values:
  * SSE4   Most conservative optimization
  * AVX    Use AVX instruction set 
  * AVX2   Use AVX2 instruction set 
  * NATIVE Use appropriate instruction set on your machine
  Add to cmake command line e.g: -D SIMD_ARCH=SSE4

BUILD_DOC
  Enable/disable Doxygen generation of Sakura API HTML documentation
  To disable documentation generation, add to cmake command line: -D BUILD_DOC:BOOL=OFF

3.4 Build Sakura

[build]$ make

3.5 Generate Sakura API HTML documentation

You can skip this step if you specified -D BUILD_DOC:BOOL=OFF on cmake command line.
 
[build]$ make apidoc

4. Testing
----------

This step allows you to verify that your installation of Sakura is working correctly.

[build]$ make test

5. Final install
----------------

[build]$ make install

If you need to install Sakura library in a directory such as /usr/local which requires root privileges, you must run the command as root:
[build]$ su
[build]# make install
